# Chore

Chore is yet another opinionated command line task management utility.

Chore uses a plain text file format greatly influenced by but incompatible with
[todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/).  This format interplays nicely with plain
text-friendly tooling such as git and grep, and can be easily maintained
manually in a text editor.

Chore's command line interface was broadly influenced by
[taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)'s.  In particular, Chore borrows the
filter-command-modification pattern and the `key.mod:` syntax.
